##Watched videos.  created accounts. created aws budget and billing alarm using console.  Ran into a permission error setting up same via CLI.  i rewatched the video a second time to make sure i did not miss steps via CLI. Created Lucid Chart.  Learned in week2 that i did add admin policy to user.  corrected it.
